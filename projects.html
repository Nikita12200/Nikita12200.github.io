              <u>FLAPPY BIRD GAME USING UNITY
              </u>
            </h3>
            <br>
            <p>Flying Flappy Bird is an arcade-style game in which the player controls the bird Faby, 
              which moves persistently to the right. The player is tasked with navigating Faby 
              through pairs of pipes that have equally sized gaps placed at random heights. Faby 
              automatically descends and only ascends when the player taps the touchscreen. Each 
              successful pass through a pair of pipes awards the player one point. Colliding with a 
              pipe or the ground ends the gameplay.
            <br>
            This project is developed using Unity Game Engine. The language used for the 
            development of this project is C# . The project file contains assets and other files such 
            as C# scripts, prefabs, audio etc.
            Unity is, essentially, a well-rounded game engine that truly does simplify game 
            development</p>
